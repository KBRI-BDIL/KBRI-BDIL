### 🔎 Research Interests
The primary focus is how **mother-child interaction** reflects their relationship at the human brain level.

Beyond this, our research extends to:
1. **Investigate Molecular-Brain Correlations**: Elucidating structural and functional brain differences through DNA analysis (WGS, Genotyping) and multi-modal neuroimaging.
2. **Track Developmental Trajectories**: Researching the growth patterns of behavior and brain development in children for clinical applications.
3. **Develop Digital Therapeutics (DTx)**: Creating AI-based digital therapeutic content and identifying biomarkers for developmental disorders using multimodal biometric signals.
4. **AI-based Diagnosis for Neurodevelopmental Disorders**: Developing personalized differential diagnosis and prediction technology for brain development disorders using AI-based analysis.
